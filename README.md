# Featherwalk's Custom Magic Cards

This page acts as a portfolio for both **Typescript**, which I decided to learn for job-hunting purposes, and **Magic: The Gathering** card design.

Recently I attended a Magic Con and discovered a new, deeper love for the game and the community. I have since been researching how to become a member of the design team for Magic. I've always enjoyed tinkering with silly card designs, and this is a more serious attempt to dissect the system and play around in it a little.

My end game with these cards is to print out labels or something and create decks or cubes that I can playtest with my Commander pod and refine. **This is not mean as a commercial product of any kind. Please do not try to sell these designs or pass them off as real magic cards.**

## Technologies

- Typescript
- Vanilla CSS
- Fontawesome

This page was my first typescript project.

## Future Enhancements

I'll be rolling out new tweaks here and there, but it is not a high priority. I plan to move on to some other projects first to refine what I've learned here. These are some things I'd like to add/improve:

- filters for list views.
- Refined rules text on the cards.
- The ability to export a sheet of labels to print these as proxies.
