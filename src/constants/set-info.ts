  [Set.Daydream as string]: 'Fighting Fire with Fashion.\n Daydream takes place in Diamond City, an isolated island city. The city is being slowly devoured from beneath, so they build higher and higher. Their heroes fight monsters for glory and salvation, using weapons built into their flashy and fashionable outfits. Diamond City is a dynamic community sandwhiched between survival and satisfaction, its culture dominated by ten "brands", each represented by one of the color pairs in this set.\n I am planning to build a cube with these cards and about 250 official cards to playtest them with my friends. They are designed for this limited environment.',
